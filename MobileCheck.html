			Checks the screen width on the page load and adds it as a hidden value
			in the form. The idea is to check the screen size on login and redirect
			them to the proper pages from there. I don't think we would need separate
			pages for mobile, just different styles and use PHP to check the type and
			print out HTML tags with "mobile" or "nonMobile" classes. I don't know if
			this is the best way to go about it, but there isn't a direct way to check
			screen size with PHP.
			
			I also found this PHP class on the internet, although I don't know if we would\
			be allowed to use it.
